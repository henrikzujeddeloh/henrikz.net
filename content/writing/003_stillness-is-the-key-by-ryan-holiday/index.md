Ryan Holiday is a master at bringing the ancient practice of stoicism into the modern world. With many anecdotes from historical figures of all kinds, he shows how stoicism can be applied to a plethora of situations one might encounter. Often, these situations are not relatable, but the lessons can still be applied to one's life to a degree. In "Stillness is the Key", this is no different. Here are a few key takeaways I got from this book.

- Being silent gives one the opportunity to listen to both yourself and the world around you---unlocking truths you may not have had without pausing and listening.
- Sometimes, if not often, inaction is the best action to take in a particular situation. Stepping back, waiting, and then acting, if even necessary, can be more effective. This can be especially true in high-pressure situations.
- In a world constantly filled with noise, we should appreciate or even seek moments of silence and solitude instead of squandering them with more noise.

This is one of those books that has a very clear message, which _could_ be brought across in a few pages. There is a great benefit in reading the collection of anecdotes and spending more time with the topic, however. It sinks in deeper the longer you read, and now I am motivated to find more stillness and pause in my life.
