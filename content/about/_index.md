![](me.avif "90%")

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I am currently living with my girlfriend in Heidelberg, Germany and am working on my PhD in the field of MRI physics. I train for and regularly participate in triathlons and other endurance sports. As I have a deep interest in technology and how things work, I enjoy spending free time working on little projects either out of interest or to improve a small part of daily life. Sometimes I may also be reading or dabbling in a little bit of photography.

If you happen share any of these interests or hobbies, then I think you are in the right place! If not, why have a look around anyway? I hope my writing and other content will be of interest to you. If you have any questions, comments, or just want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at henrikz.net@pm.me.
